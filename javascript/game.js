//Step 1: Create variables on which all your functions operate (characters, stats).
var characters = ["Mufasa", "Bambis-Mom", "Gothel", "Queen", "A-n-I", "Frollo", "Kerchak", "James"]; 
var hp = 100
var atk = [a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h]
var catk = [a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h]
//Step2: Create FUNCTIONs for your INTEGERs. Make sure attack stats are RANDOM.

//Step 3: Assign stats to EACH character.

/*Step 4: Create FUNCTIONs which subtract attack value from hp and add increasing multiple of base atk
to current atk power after every turn. For balance, catk will need to be much higher than base atk.*/

/*Step 5: Create an EVENT which causes characters to respond to the CLICK of a mouse. Then create a FUNCTION which causes
opponent to counter attack after player clicks.*/
//Caution: Keep in mind in which order the characters take their turn.

//Step 6: Create a FUNCTION which removes character from roster when hp =< 0

/*Step 7: Create a CONDITIONAL which displays the victory screen when all opponents are eliminated, 
and one which displays the Game Over screen when player's hp =< 0*/

//Step 8:
