	to current atk power after every turn. For balance, catk will need to be much higher than base atk.*/

	opponent to counter attack after player clicks.*/

			<h3>Mufasa</h3>

				A father of one. Everything the light touches is Mufasa's kingdom. He's strong, fierce, and voiced by James Earl Jones.

				A mother of one. She doesn't have a real name, but how can you go wrong with one who raised the prince of the forest himself? Bambi's Mom knows how intimidating and dangerous the forest can get, but it's home, and she'll guide you every step of the way and make even the the most savage environment a magical trip. Her favorite food is flower blossoms.

			<h3>Mother Gothel</h3>
			<p>
				A surrogate mother of one. When she's not snatching babies out of their crib, she's very caring and nurturing. A little vain, perhaps, but mother knows best, and she'll give you everything a child could ask for, so long as you don't leave your house, ever. She'll bring you delicious food, paint and decorate your bedroom She's also got an ear for music, so she'll appreciate you singing a song for her every day.

				A stepmother of one. Whether in the terrifying forests or in the amiable cottage of the seven dwarves, the queen will not let her frown waver in the face of anything. She's somewhat insecure about her body image, even keeping a mirror in her throne room at all times, so be careful what you say around her. She prefers you wear rags. Yes, she's high maitenance, but when she's calm, she'll let you roam wherever you please. In fact, she might never look you in the face, which is the highest praise you can ask from her! She's got a fun chemistry set you can play with in her basement. Her favorite food is apples.

He'll let you use Notre Dame's decor as a playground when he's out working, so there's hours of entertainment every day.

				Blood father of one, surrogate father of one. Kerchak probably doesn't want you, since he knows that a lone human is never alone for long.
